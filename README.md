Target- indoor localisation of target node
Problem Type- Regression problem to locate the coordinates of target node using triangulation method (3 APs), using Square method (4 APs), and checking which ones turns the best to locate the device using different methodolgies also to calculate the accuracy and other paramneters of the model 1 and model 2.
Procedure- Room1 (Nescafe area) at IIT jammu was covered with obstacles with 17 data sets (taking different angles with 1.5 coordinate distance) on which Triangulation was applied which comnes out to be the best model with accuracy, least mse, mae values.
         - Room2 (open space) was covered again but with 1.5k+ entries (taking different angles with eqaully spaced coordinates) on which Square method was applied with less accuracy, higher error values.
        
        Basically, we are tring to comapre traingular method with square with change in strategy , we are cross checking using plotting
